# RESMARK Pilot Migration Plan - Reality Check

## The Truth

We need to acknowledge what we DON'T know:
- Our 5 RESMARK commands are **untested theories**
- The "empirically-discovered" patterns are **hypothetical**
- The MDD methodology is **unproven**
- We have **zero real migration data**

## New Priority: Generate Real Data

Stop building infrastructure. Start doing real migrations.

## The Pilot Migration Approach

### Step 1: Pick ONE Simple Component

Choose the simplest possible Angular component from `resmark-nodejs/`:
- Ideally <100 lines
- Minimal dependencies
- Clear UI behavior
- Has some database interaction

Example candidates:
- A simple search input
- A data table
- A form field
- A status indicator

### Step 2: Manual Migration First

Do the migration MANUALLY without any tools:
1. Read the Angular code
2. Write the React equivalent by hand
3. Document every decision made
4. Note every pattern encountered
5. Track time spent

This gives us our baseline truth.

### Step 3: Test Our Commands

Now try using our commands:
1. Run `anti-pattern-detector.md` - Does it find real issues?
2. Run `explain-knowledge.md` - Is the knowledge useful?
3. Run `mdd-cycle.md` - Does the workflow make sense?

Document:
- What worked
- What failed
- What was missing
- What was wrong

### Step 4: Try Generic Tools

Use the generic tools from the cloned repos:
1. Try `tools/code-migrate.md`
2. Try `tools/test-generator.md`
3. Try relevant agents

Compare results with manual migration.

### Step 5: Measure & Learn

Create a simple scorecard:

```markdown
## Migration Scorecard

**Component**: [Name]
**Lines of Code**: [Count]

### Manual Migration
- Time: [X hours]
- Issues encountered: [List]
- Patterns discovered: [List]

### RESMARK Commands
- Useful? [Yes/No/Partial]
- Accuracy: [0-100%]
- Time saved: [Positive/Negative]
- Critical misses: [List]

### Generic Tools
- Useful? [Yes/No/Partial]
- Better than RESMARK? [Yes/No]
- Integration potential: [High/Low]

### Verdict
- Continue with current approach? [Yes/No]
- Pivots needed: [List]
```

## Success Criteria

The pilot is successful if we learn:
1. Whether our anti-patterns actually occur
2. If the session patterns are real issues
3. Whether visual regression is truly needed
4. If our commands provide value

## What We're NOT Doing

- NOT building more infrastructure
- NOT creating elaborate validation layers
- NOT assuming our patterns are correct
- NOT treating commands as proven

## Timeline

Day 1: Manual migration of one component
Day 2: Test with RESMARK commands
Day 3: Test with generic tools
Day 4: Analysis and decision

## Decision Points

After the pilot:

**If commands are useful (>60% accurate)**:
- Continue with simplified integration
- Fix identified issues
- Run second pilot

**If commands are not useful (<40% accurate)**:
- Scrap current approach
- Focus on generic tools
- Rebuild from actual learnings

**If mixed results (40-60%)**:
- Cherry-pick what worked
- Discard what didn't
- Iterate rapidly

## The Real MDD Methodology

Migration Driven Development should mean:
1. Try to migrate something
2. Learn from what breaks
3. Build tools to fix those specific breaks
4. Repeat

Not: Build theoretical tools for imagined problems.

## Next Immediate Action

1. Open `resmark-nodejs/`
2. Find the simplest component
3. Start manual migration
4. Document everything

Stop theorizing. Start migrating.
